// Analysis of batch processing logic in broadcast-simple.js

console.log("=== BATCH SYSTEM ANALYSIS ===\n");

console.log("Expected Behavior:");
console.log("- BATCH_SIZE = 5");
console.log("- Process 5 calls in parallel");
console.log("- Wait for ALL 5 to complete");
console.log("- Wait 2 seconds");
console.log("- Start next batch of 5");
console.log("");

console.log("Expected calls per minute:");
console.log("- If average call duration = 10-15 seconds");
console.log("- Each batch takes: 10-15 seconds + 2 seconds wait = 12-17 seconds");
console.log("- Batches per minute: 60 / 15 = 4 batches");
console.log("- Calls per minute: 4 batches × 5 calls = 20 calls");
console.log("- Maximum (if calls are 10s): 60 / 12 × 5 = 25 calls");
console.log("");

console.log("ISSUE FOUND - The main problem:");
console.log("");

console.log("1. BATCH LOGIC FLAW:");
console.log("   The code has TWO parallel systems running:");
console.log("   a) Batch system (lines 597-643)");
console.log("   b) Progress monitoring with setInterval (lines 819-855)");
console.log("");

console.log("2. THE REAL ISSUE - Look at line 730:");
console.log("   while (totalActiveCallsCount > 0 || callQueue.length > 0) {");
console.log("      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));");
console.log("      ...");
console.log("   }");
console.log("");
console.log("   This loop runs AFTER startNewBatch() but it doesn't control batching!");
console.log("   It just waits for everything to complete.");
console.log("");

console.log("3. THE BATCH SYSTEM IS NOT ENFORCED:");
console.log("   - startNewBatch() starts 5 calls");
console.log("   - But there's no mechanism to PREVENT more calls from starting");
console.log("   - The checkAndStartNextBatch() is called on EVERY call end (line 691)");
console.log("   - This means as soon as ANY call ends, it can trigger a new batch!");
console.log("");

console.log("4. RACE CONDITION:");
console.log("   When multiple calls end at nearly the same time:");
console.log("   - Call 1 ends → completedInCurrentBatch++");
console.log("   - Call 2 ends → completedInCurrentBatch++");
console.log("   - Both might see completedInCurrentBatch >= currentBatchCount");
console.log("   - Both might try to start new batches!");
console.log("");

console.log("5. NO QUEUE THROTTLING:");
console.log("   The processNextInQueue() function (line 646) will process calls");
console.log("   as long as there are available channels, regardless of batch state.");
console.log("");

console.log("CALCULATION:");
console.log("If the system is making 60-80 calls per minute:");
console.log("- That's 1-1.3 calls per second");
console.log("- This suggests calls are being started continuously");
console.log("- NOT in controlled batches of 5");
console.log("");

console.log("THE FIX:");
console.log("The batch system needs to be enforced by:");
console.log("1. Preventing new batches until current batch is FULLY complete");
console.log("2. Adding a flag to block processNextInQueue during batch wait");
console.log("3. Ensuring only ONE process can start a new batch");
console.log("4. Actually limiting concurrent calls to BATCH_SIZE, not MAX_CONCURRENT_CALLS");
