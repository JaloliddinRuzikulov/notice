# Employee Data Persistence Implementation

## Overview
Employee data is now persisted to a JSON file to prevent data loss when the server restarts.

## Implementation Details

### File Location
- Employee data is stored in: `/data/employees.json`
- The data directory is created automatically if it doesn't exist

### Features
1. **Automatic Loading**: Employee data is loaded from the JSON file when the server starts
2. **Automatic Saving**: Data is saved whenever employees are:
   - Added
   - Updated
   - Deleted
3. **Initial Data**: If no employees.json file exists, the system initializes with sample data
4. **Error Handling**: The system handles file read/write errors gracefully

### Code Changes
Modified `/routes/employees.js` to include:
- `loadEmployees()` function - loads data from JSON file on startup
- `saveEmployees()` function - saves data to JSON file
- Async handlers for all CRUD operations to ensure data persistence

### Data Format
The employees.json file stores an array of employee objects:
```json
[
  {
    "id": "1",
    "name": "Abdullayev Jasur",
    "position": "Boshliq",
    "department": "Rahbariyat",
    "phoneNumber": "901234567"
  }
]
```

### Server Logs
The server logs show persistence activity:
- "Loaded X employees from file" - on successful load
- "Saved X employees to file" - on successful save
- "No existing employees file found, will create on first save" - on first run
- "Initializing with sample employee data" - when creating initial data

## Testing
The persistence has been tested and verified:
1. Add/Update/Delete operations save data immediately
2. Server restart loads the saved data correctly
3. File errors are handled without crashing the server
