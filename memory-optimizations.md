# Memory Optimizations Applied

## Date: July 9, 2025

### 1. Session Store Optimization
**File**: `server.js`
- Changed session cleanup from 24 hours to 1 hour
- Reduces memory accumulation from expired sessions

### 2. Memory Monitoring
**File**: `server.js`
- Added memory usage logging every 5 minutes
- Tracks RSS, heap total, heap used, and external memory

### 3. Graceful Shutdown
**File**: `server.js`
- Added SIGTERM and SIGINT handlers
- Properly closes all resources on shutdown
- Prevents zombie processes and memory leaks

### 4. SIP Backend Cleanup
**File**: `lib/sip-backend.js`
- Added `destroy()` method for proper cleanup
- Clears all intervals and timeouts
- Ends all active calls
- Clears Maps and removes event listeners
- Closes UDP socket

### 5. WebSocket Proxy Optimization
**File**: `lib/ws-to-udp-proxy.js`
- Reduced connection timeout from 5 minutes to 1 minute
- Added `closeAll()` method for shutdown
- Properly closes UDP sockets on cleanup

### 6. Broadcast Memory Management
**File**: `routes/broadcast-simple.js`
- Limited in-memory broadcasts to 100 (MAX_BROADCASTS_IN_MEMORY)
- Reduced history file limit from 10,000 to 1,000 broadcasts
- Added automatic memory cleanup every 5 minutes
- Added resource cleanup for completed broadcasts

### 7. Global Variables Management
- SIP backend instance made global for proper cleanup
- WebSocket proxy accessible globally for shutdown

## Memory Leak Prevention

### Fixed Issues:
1. **Event Listener Accumulation**: SIP backend now removes all listeners on destroy
2. **Unclosed Intervals**: All intervals tracked and cleared
3. **Growing Maps**: Maps have size limits and cleanup routines
4. **Zombie Processes**: Child processes properly terminated
5. **Connection Accumulation**: WebSocket connections cleaned up more aggressively

## Monitoring Commands

```bash
# View memory usage in logs
tail -f /mnt/hdd128gb/qashqadaryo-iib-notification/logs/server.log | grep MEMORY

# Monitor process memory
watch -n 5 "ps aux | grep node | grep qashqadaryo"

# Check for memory leaks
node --expose-gc /mnt/hdd128gb/qashqadaryo-iib-notification/server.js
```

## Expected Results
- Memory usage should stabilize after initial startup
- No continuous growth in heap usage
- Proper cleanup on server restart
- Better performance under load
